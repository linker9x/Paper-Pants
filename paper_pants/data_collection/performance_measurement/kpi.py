def CAGR(dataframe:pd.DataFrame, period:str)->float:
    """CAGR
        Compound annual growth rate. Calculate the CARG and return it.
        Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is a business and investing 
        specific term for the geometric progression ratio that provides 
        a constant rate of return over the time period. CAGR is not an 
        accounting term, but it is often used to describe some element 
        of the business, for example revenue, units delivered, registered 
        users, etc. CAGR dampens the effect of volatility of periodic 
        returns that can render arithmetic means irrelevant. It is 
        particularly useful to compare growth rates from various data 
        sets of common domain such as revenue growth of companies in 
        the same industry or sector.

        CAGR is equivalent to the more generic exponential growth rate 
        when the exponential growth interval is one year.

        function to calculate annualized volatility of a trading strategy
        
        In finance, volatility (symbol Ïƒ) is the degree of variation of a trading price series over time, usually measured by the standard deviation of logarithmic returns.
        Historic volatility measures a time series of past market prices. Implied volatility looks forward in time, being derived from the market price of a market-traded derivative (in particular, an option).

    """
        function to calculate sharpe ratio ; rf is the risk free rate
        In finance, the Sharpe ratio (also known as the Sharpe index, the Sharpe measure, and the reward-to-variability ratio) measures the performance of an investment (e.g., a security or portfolio) compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. 
        It is defined as the difference between the returns of the investment and the risk-free return, divided by the standard deviation of the investment (i.e., its volatility). 
        It represents the additional amount of return that an investor receives per unit of increase in risk.

def sortino(dataframe:pd.DataFrame, period:str, rf:float)->float:
    """
        function to calculate sortino ratio ; rf is the risk free rate
        
        The Sortino ratio measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment asset, portfolio, or strategy.
        It is a modification of the Sharpe ratio but penalizes only those returns falling below a user-specified 
        target or required rate of return, while the Sharpe ratio penalizes both upside and downside volatility equally. 
        Though both ratios measure an investment's risk-adjusted return, they do so in significantly different ways that 
        will frequently lead to differing conclusions as to the true nature of the investment's return-generating efficiency.

        The Sortino ratio is used as a way to compare the risk-adjusted performance of programs with differing risk and return profiles. 
        In general, risk-adjusted returns seek to normalize the risk across programs and then see which has the higher return unit per risk.
